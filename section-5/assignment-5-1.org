#+TITLE: Assignment: Build Your Own DockerFile and Run Container From It

- Dockerfiles are part process workflow and part art
- Take existing Node.js app and Dockerize it
- Make =Dockerfile=. Build it. Test it. Push it. (rm it). Run it.
- Expect this to be iterative. Rarely do I get it right the first time
- Details in =dockerfile-assignment-1/Dockerfile=
- Use the Alpine version of the official ='node'= 6.x image
- Expected result is web site at =http://localhost=


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  docker image build -t assignment-4-1 .
  docker container run -p 80:3000 --rm assignment-4-1
#+END_SRC
