#+TITLE: Assignment: Edit Code Running in Containers with Bind Mounts

- Use a Jekyll "Static Site Generator" to star a local web server
- Dont't have to be web developer: this is example of bridging the gap between
  local file access and apps running in containers
- Source code is in the course repo under =bindmount=sample-1=
- We edit files with editor on our host using native tools
- Container detects changes with host files and updates web server
- Start container with ~docker run -p 80:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve~
- Refresh our browser to see changes
- Change the file in =_post\= and refresh browser to see changes
